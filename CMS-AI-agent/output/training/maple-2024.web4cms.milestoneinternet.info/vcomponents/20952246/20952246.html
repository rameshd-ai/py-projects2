        <h2>What Personal Information We Collect and Why </h2>
        Here we describe what information is collected and reasons for collecting it. The categories of information collected are as follows:
        <div class="boxspacer"></div>
        <ul>
            <li class="padbttom">
                <h3>Site Visit Trackers </h3>
                Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to track their journey through the website.
                <div class="boxspacer"></div>
                Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer's IP address, which could be used to personally identify you, but Google does not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third-party data processor (<a href="#thirdparty-data">see section below</a>).
                <div class="boxspacer"></div>
                GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on Google's developer guides. Our website uses the analytics.js implementation of GA. Disabling cookies on your internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.
                <div class="boxspacer"></div>
                In addition to Google Analytics, this website may collect information (held in the public domain) attributed to the IP address of the computer or device that is being used to access it.

                We only receive an email when a user mails us using an email link. There are no third-party data processors or intermediaries involved. <br>
                The data is collated into an email and sent to us over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>. Our SMTP servers are protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">TLS</a> (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.

                <h3>Revenue Recovery Emails</h3>
                As part of Revenue Recovery model, we work with re-marketing service companies to send notification messages if you have abandoned your cart without making a purchase. This is for the sole purpose of reminding customers to complete the purchase if they’d wish to. The re-marketing service companies do a real-time capture of your email ID and cookies to send an email invite to complete the transaction if the customer abandons the cart. However, the email ID of the customer is deleted from their database as soon as the purchase is complete.
